Blattfruit Pie
===========
My stupid brother pranks my family by changing the backgrounds of laptops, phones, and tablets to his stupid face.  Most recently he changed my mother's background to "Jeff Goldblum is Watching You Poop".  This is retaliation on her behalf.

Version 1.0
-----------
Every 5 minutes bash script runs that...
* Checks for an external timestamp and stores is locally
* Shows a dialog when that timestamp has passed saying "Would you like a blattfruit pie with that?"

Note
----
* This currently assumes that the user does not have an existing crontab

TODOs
-----
* Skin the dialog box to look just like the one from Space Quest III.
* Change cursor icon to match the cursor from Space Quest III.
